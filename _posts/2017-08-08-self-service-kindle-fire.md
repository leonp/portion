title: Running self-service on Amazon silk
---

This probably doesn't look that exciting and I apologise for the close ups of my hands. But it is interesting. This is our library self-service progressive web app running on an old Kindle Fire and printing a receipt. The app will run on any device with a touchscreen and doesn't need any printer driver; which makes for lots of _potential_ uses.
