[Zarf dug up this gem of a photo](http://blog.zarfhome.com/2017/08/two-word-parser-1966-ad.html), which suggests some wonderful images of astronauts struggling with early [IF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) parsers (`I'm sorry, I don't understand the word "hatch."`) As well as [being a teenage RPGer](/fantasy-maps-nabokov/) I also programmed IF on a Sinclair Spectrum (which only boasted 42k more RAM than the 1966 Apollo 11 PC -- anomalous to [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), maybe). Zarf is right, I think; there is something powerful and flexible in this restrained, 2D interface. Perhaps it's time for the return of verb noun IF (set on a rocket flying to the moon).
