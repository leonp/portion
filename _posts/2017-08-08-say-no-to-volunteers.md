title: Save your local! Should volunteers help keep our public libraries open? (No).
---

[Not just because by "stepping in" you're speeding up the end of libraries](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/08/public-libraries-at-the-crossroads-should-volunteers-be-keeping-them-open), nor because of any notion of professionalism. No &#8212; volunteer&#8211;run libraries are an experiment in a mean, barebones state, testing how far governments can go in divesting themselves of any responsibility or cost. They're a softer target than, say, adult care, but they're the *first* target, the first justification.
