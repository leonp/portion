> Sometimes with old tracks, I am reading out what I’ve written, and I don’t understand half of it - but it sounds good. I listen to people and their conversations, but I also misinterpret things - a bit of a Smith family trait that. But I try to put humour in there too. Not everyone gets the jokes. The Russian fans get the jokes actually - they get them.
