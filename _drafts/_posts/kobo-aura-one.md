This is quite an interesting new ereader from Kobo as it integrates directly with Overdrive, a service that allows you to *borrow* ebooks from libraries for a limited time. Before, you'd have to use an app and/or the horror of Adobe Digital Editions to get the books onto your device. This removes a lot of friction. -- But what I'm really interested in is removing the barrier between library website and catalogue. This is what a library website home page should look like.
