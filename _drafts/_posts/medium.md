Not sure what the &#8220;full experience&#8221; is exactly; I was just clicking a link to another page and this told me to login to Twitter. Medium provides an [increasingly poor reading experience](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/medium_dickbars). It started with some [dodgy typographical proximity](https://www.leonpaternoster.com/2014/12/medium-paragraphs-wrong/), and has extended to a confusing <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr>, zillions of fixed banners, pointless sharing icons and this downright rude interjection. As ever, the lesson is: host your own writing otherwise someone will try to &#8220;monetise&#8221; it by chucking stuff in the way of the reader.
