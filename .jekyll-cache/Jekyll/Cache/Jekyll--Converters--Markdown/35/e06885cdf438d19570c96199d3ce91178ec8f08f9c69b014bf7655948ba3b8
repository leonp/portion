I"B<p>Bit tired, too much work (as in worrying about Windows 10 tablet updates work; nothing fun, mind you, the exact opposite of fun, in fact) and stuck on the laptop at home. I can sketch loads of stuff (see above) but canâ€™t motivate myself to actually build it. I need to work less with Windows 10 updates, so I do.</p>
