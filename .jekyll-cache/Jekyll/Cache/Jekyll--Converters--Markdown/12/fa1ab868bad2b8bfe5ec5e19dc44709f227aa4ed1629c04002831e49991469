I"æ<p>Not sure what the ‚Äúfull experience‚Äù is exactly; I was just clicking a link to another page and this told me to login to Twitter. Medium provides an <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/medium_dickbars">increasingly poor reading experience</a>. It started with some <a href="https://www.leonpaternoster.com/2014/12/medium-paragraphs-wrong/">dodgy typographical proximity</a>, and has extended to a confusing <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr>, zillions of fixed banners, pointless sharing icons and this downright rude interjection. As ever, the lesson is: host your own writing otherwise someone will try to ‚Äúmonetise‚Äù it by chucking stuff in the way of the reader.</p>
