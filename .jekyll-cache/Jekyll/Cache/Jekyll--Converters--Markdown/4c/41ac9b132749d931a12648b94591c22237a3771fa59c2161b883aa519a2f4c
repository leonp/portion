I"Ž<p>A lovely read on <a href="https://longreads.com/2017/08/24/fantasy-maps-game-of-thrones/">maps in fantasy books</a>. I was a teenage <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr>er, which involved drawing maps of made up, mostly medieval worlds. What is the meaning of this? â€“ Containment, control, wish fulfillment for a teenage boy, probably. Also notes Nabokovâ€™s precise, cartographic geography in <cite>Pale Fire</cite> and <cite>Pnin</cite> (around Waindell and Cremona, as well as Zembla), and Kinboteâ€™s handsome, accurate plans of the Onhava palace. Nabokov also encouraged his students to map Dublin when teaching <cite>Ulysses</cite>.</p>
