I"ï<p>This is quite an interesting new ereader from Kobo as it integrates directly with Overdrive, a service that allows you to <em>borrow</em> ebooks from libraries for a limited time. Before, youâ€™d have to use an app and/or the horror of Adobe Digital Editions to get the books onto your device. This removes a lot of friction. â€“ But what Iâ€™m really interested in is removing the barrier between library website and catalogue. This is what a library website home page should look like.</p>
