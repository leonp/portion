I"P<p>Well worth reading <a href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/">CSS Utility Classes and “Separation of Concerns”</a>; it’s excellent (and thorough) on why utility CSS (e.g. <a href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a>) is the sanest, most “semantic” approach to CSS, and why it’s not the same as inline styles. Only bit I’d question is its approach to repeatable blocks of code. Wathan suggests adding classes like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">btn-purple</code>​; instead, use includes and variables to generate HTML with utility classes. In Jekyll you’d use something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include button.html bg=purple text=white</code> to generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a class="bg-purple white"</code></p>
