I"‹<p>This is a photo of Stuttgart city library, built in 2012. It is, of course, different from most provincial British libraries, not least in its budget (around 60m Euros). Thereâ€™s something sacred in this shot, which makes the people seem incidental to the building. It doesnâ€™t look <em>comfortable</em>. Still, imagine a government investing in such a grand idea of a library in 2017.</p>
