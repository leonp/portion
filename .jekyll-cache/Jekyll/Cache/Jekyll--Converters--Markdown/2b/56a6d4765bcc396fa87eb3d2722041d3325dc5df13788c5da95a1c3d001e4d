I"@<p><a href="http://blog.zarfhome.com/2017/08/two-word-parser-1966-ad.html">Zarf dug up this gem of a photo</a>, which suggests some wonderful images of astronauts struggling with early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">IF</a> parsers (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I'm sorry, I don't understand the word "hatch."</code>) As well as <a href="/fantasy-maps-nabokov/">being a teenage RPGer</a> I also programmed IF on a Sinclair Spectrum (which only boasted 42k more RAM than the 1966 Apollo 11 PC – anomalous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>, maybe). Zarf is right, I think; there is something powerful and flexible in this restrained, 2D interface. Perhaps it’s time for the return of verb noun IF (set on a rocket flying to the moon).</p>
