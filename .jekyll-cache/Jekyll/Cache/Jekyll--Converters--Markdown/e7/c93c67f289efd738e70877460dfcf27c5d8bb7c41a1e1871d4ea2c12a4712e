I"R<p>I changed TDP’s URL structure. Apologies for any confusion, although I suspect the number of RSS subscribers is somewhat low. Why? URL structures should reflect site hierarchy, and before I went with Jekyll’s default, which includes the month and date, even though there are no month and date archives. The site is flat, and the URLs now reflect that (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.thisdaysportion.xyz/post-title/</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.thisdaysportion.xyz/YYYY/MM/post-title/</code>).</p>
