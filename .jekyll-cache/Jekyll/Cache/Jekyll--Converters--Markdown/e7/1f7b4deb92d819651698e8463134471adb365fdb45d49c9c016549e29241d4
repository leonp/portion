I"¡<p>TFWâ€¦ you finally start to <em>get</em> an artist, or piece of art. It happened to me driving back from the gym, playing one of the two CDs I have to hand in the car. Iâ€™m not sure why I chose these two. One is a Kinks singles collection, which I played on every journey for about three months. It is of course impossible not to love The Kinks deeply. The other is <cite>Trout Mask Replica</cite>, which is less lovable. The song was <cite>Orange Claw Hammer</cite> and I was turning into the slip road that leads into the Waitrose car park. Itâ€™s just Beefheartâ€™s blues growl, sometimes stumbling over the lines, and it was so rich, magical. It was eight minutes to seven in the evening and it was dark and mild. I was going to buy lager. I donâ€™t like the blues that much, just John Lee Hooker and Junior Kimbrough, really, but this was breathtaking, followed rightly, righteously by totally controlled cacophony.</p>
