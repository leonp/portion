I"<p>This is a photo of Stuttgart city library, built in 2012. It is, of course, different from most provincial British libraries, not least in its budget (around 60m Euros). There’s something sacred in this shot, which makes the people seem incidental to the building. It doesn’t look <em>comfortable</em>. Still, imagine a government investing in such a grand idea of a library in 2017.</p>
